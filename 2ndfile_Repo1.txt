Imagine, there are two remote repositories. Each repository is a separate side.
You agreed that

the first repository owns the prefix foo-
the second repository owns the prefix bar/
(the names are arbitrary)
Only branches with such the prefixes will be synchronized and visible on both sides.

Git-conflicts solving.
Conflicts may occur only if your merge or commit to another side.
The prefix owner will win in case of any conflicting git-commits. Commits of a loser will be rejected, but he just has to repeat his commits again from his local repository after a Git update.
The package is prepared, but does not include conflict informing. For this reason, you can ask your another side to perform git-merging from your branch into their. Or just recheck your action after running of git-sync and repeat them if needed.

For now, Git-tags are excluded from synchronization.
